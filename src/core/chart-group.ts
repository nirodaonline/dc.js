/**
 * A chart group often corresponds to a set of linked charts.
 * For example, when using crossfilter, it is typically charts linked to same crossfilter instance.
 * It specifies the set of charts which should be updated when a filter changes on one of the charts.
 * The {@linkcode BaseMixin} methods {@linkcode BaseMixin.renderGroup | renderGroup} and
 * {@linkcode BaseMixin.redrawGroup | redrawGroup} call {@linkcode renderAll} and {@linkcode redrawAll}
 * on the chart group.
 *
 * `dc` charts created without specifying a chartGroup are registered with the default ChartGroup.
 * It is recommended that all `dc` charts are created with an explicit chartGroup.
 *
 * This has been introduced in v5 to facilitate automated garage collection of charts.
 * SPAs (Single Page Applications), or any other environments where set of charts need to be unloaded,
 * should use explicit chartGroups.
 *
 * It is possible to register non dc charts (or any other object) with the chartGroup.
 * Please see {@linkcode IMinimalChart} to understand the methods the chartGroup will be invoking.
 *
 * `dc` charts do not hard depend on this class. So, it is possible to replace it with any compliant
 * implementation. {@linkcode IChartGroup} specifies what rest of the `dc` expects.
